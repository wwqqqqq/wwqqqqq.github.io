The game *[Among Us](https://innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php)* is a multiplayer online game released in 2018, developed by Innersloth.

This project build a 3D scene that resembles the activity in the lobby (waiting room) of the game *Among Us*. In a typical game play, the astronauts (players) first gather in the lobby and walk around before the game begins.
